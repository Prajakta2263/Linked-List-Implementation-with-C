# Linked-List-Implementation-with-C
Overview:
This repository contains a collection of projects related to linked list implementations in C. The projects were developed during my first year, focusing on basic concepts of linked lists, such as adding nodes, linear searching, and traversal.

**Description:**
Linked lists are fundamental data structures widely used in computer science and software development. Each project in this repository explores a specific application or variation of linked lists, providing a hands-on learning experience with basic C programming concepts.

**Projects Included:**
- Birth-Death Records Management
- Blood Bank Management
- Event registration Management
  
**Key Concepts:**
- Adding nodes to a linked list
- Linear searching within a linked list
- Traversal of linked list nodes
  
**Note:** These projects were developed during my first year of studies, primarily to understand and implement basic concepts of linked lists using C programming language.
