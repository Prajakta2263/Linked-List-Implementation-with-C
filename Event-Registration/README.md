**Overview:**
This program is designed to manage participant registrations for events using a linked list data structure. Participants can be added to the list along with details such as their name, the event they have registered for, and their semester. Additionally, the program allows for the display of participants and deletion of specific participants from the list.

**Features:**

- Add Participant: Users can add participants to the event registration list by providing their name, the event they are registering for, and their semester.
- Display Participants: The program can display the list of registered participants along with their details.
- Delete Participant: Users have the option to delete a specific participant from the list based on their name or other attributes.

**Logic:**
- Define a structure to represent a participant, including attributes such as name, event, and semester.
- Implement functions to add new participants, display the list of participants, and delete participants from the list.
- Use a linked list data structure to efficiently manage participant records and perform operations such as insertion and deletion.
